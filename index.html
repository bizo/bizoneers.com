          <h2>Bizo Engineering</h2>
          <p>
          We're a small, disciplined team that gets a lot done. We have more data centers than engineers.  We write quality, scalable software.  We survived the AWS outage unscathed.  We've serviced more than 15 billion web requests in the past 6 months.</p>  

          <p>We believe in teamwork and communication: comments, design reviews, code reviews for every change, weekly tech talks.  We believe in giving developers ownership over projects.  We believe Engineering is more than coding.  We have fun and keep the beer fridge well stocked.
          </p>

          <p>We are looking for motivated problem solvers with an entrepreneurial / hacker spirit.</p>
